Conqueror
=========

A powerful chess engine which beats Chess Titan level 10. It currently implements hybrid board representation, alphabeta pruning, quiescence search, static evaluation, legal move generator, iterative deepening, MVV/LVA move reordering, makemove, unmakemove and uci move representation standard, tapered evaluation. Elostat gives the current version an ELO of 2100 measured over 50 games.
The binary released supports UCI and can be used with any UCI supporting GUI. However I suggest using Arena GUI (get the latest version from http://www.playwitharena.com/). 

Installation:
=============

1. Install Arena GUI
2. Goto engines -> Install new engine
3. Select Conqueror.exe from the dialog box
4. Goto engine -> manage (F11)
5. Select Conqueror as the current chess engine
6. Enjoy
